SVG Generator
=============

An online SVG Graphics Generation with the ability to export to SVG. 

Use it online at https://svg-generator.netlify.com/ (original version) or at https://publicdomainvectors.org/svg-generator.php (embedded version).

This is running purely in the browser and does not store / send any data anywhere.

## Background

This is a 3rd Semester Project (2011) by me. 
Haven't worked on it since then, except fixing the SVG download functionality. 
But maybe I'll find some time and get it up to date ;)
